# Assignment 4: Search Engine 

This is a longer project! Here are the [Project Instructions](Project_Instructions.pdf).


**Objectives:**

* Design a larger system, plan the implementation and submit multiple deliverables.
* Implement a search tree-based map.
* Implement a persistent data structure.




* Week 1: Plan your timeline (see below); design you solution (first UML class diagram); 
    adapt the AVL tree from class to work as a map suitable for the inverted file index and provide tests (Catch2 test would be great).
* Week 2: Implement the document parser; build the indices. 
* Week 3: Implement the query processor; user interface; and add persistence to the index.
* Week 4: Finish code and write the documentation file.

# Submission 

In addition to the code, you need to submit a markdown document called `documentation.md` containing the following information (You can copy and paste the section structure below):

## High-level Design of Solution

- UML class diagram, etc.
- High-level pseudo code for each component.

## Used Data Structures
Explanation of what data structures are used where. For each, state 
    - time and space complexity (Big-Oh),
    - why it is the appropriate data structure and what other data structure could have been used.

## User Documentation 
- How to use the software.
- Some example queries with the results.

## Performance
- Statistics for indexing all documents and timing.
